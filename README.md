Assignment 2 for CIS 3515

Greetings! If you're reading this, you've found my github page for CIS-3515 Assignment 2, 
offered by the class Mobile Application Development hosted by Temple University. This application 
is intended for use by API 27-capable emulators and devices, and was build in Android Studio. 

This application utilizes a small form to sanitize user information, with several variations on 
android's "Toast" function depending on correct or incorrect input. If the user does not correctly 
fill out all fields, a toast display informs the user of their mistake. If the passwords do not match, 
a similar display notifies the user, and finally, upon user info passing validation, a welcome toast.
